# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues by opening a GitHub issue with a clear title and minimal reproduction steps. Avoid including secrets or private keys in reports.

If the issue is sensitive, open a draft issue and mark it as "security" in the title so it can be handled discreetly.

## Support
This is a portfolio project and is maintained on a best-effort basis without a formal SLA.
